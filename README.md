# Housing Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains housing details like:
- Area (in sqft)
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Price (target variable)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps
1. Load and visualize dataset
2. Prepare feature and target variables
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate performance (MAE & RÂ² Score)
6. Predict price for a new sample house

## Sample Prediction
Predict the price for a house with:
- Area: 2500 sqft
- Bedrooms: 4
- Bathrooms: 3
